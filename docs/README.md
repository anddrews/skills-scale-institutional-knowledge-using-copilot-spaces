# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub! This collection provides comprehensive guidance on how we manage projects from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement.

## Overview

At OctoAcme, we follow a **customer-centric, iterative approach** to project management. Our process emphasizes:

- **Customer-first mindset**: Prioritizing customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Shipping small, testable increments to gather feedback and adapt quickly
- **Clear ownership**: Defined roles and responsibilities for every project
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measuring impact and iterating based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encouraging feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

## Project Lifecycle

Our projects follow a structured lifecycle with clear phases:

1. **Initiation** — Validate business need, align stakeholders, define success criteria
2. **Planning** — Break work into actionable increments, identify dependencies and risks
3. **Execution & Tracking** — Build, test, review, and iterate with regular cadence
4. **Risk Management & Communication** — Proactively manage risks and keep stakeholders informed
5. **Release & Deployment** — Deploy safely with proper validation and rollback plans
6. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** — Capture learnings and implement improvements

## Key Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and business context

## Key Artifacts

Our project management process produces and maintains several important artifacts:

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Problem statement, goals, and success metrics
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: Timeline and milestone planning
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Risk Register**: Identified risks, impacts, and mitigation strategies
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and action items for continuous improvement
- **Release Notes**: Documentation of changes and deployment information
